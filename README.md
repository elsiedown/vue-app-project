# Vue App Project
```
My first app built using Vue. A collection of my favourite music with the ability to add more to the collection.
```

## Challenges

* This was the first time that I had used Vue and I found it slightly hard to get my head around the new syntax.

* I found it slightly hard to figure out how the Vue Router worked but got there in the end!

## Wins
* I enjoyed learning something new and found it easy to pick-up the Vue basics with help from the documentation. 
* I enjoyed using Vue and found it easy to use - and thought SFCs made life easier having the styling and JS all in one place.
* I managed to implement Vue Router which was cool and got a multi-page layout working.
* Managed to implement CRUD functionality and was interesting to see how this worked differently in Vue to React.
* I enjoyed learning the skills by myself and from the help of a tutorial and it was cool to see how quickly I was able to build my first app.


## What I Learned
* How to build my first Vue app and understand Vue documentation
* Vue SFCs ( & scoped CSS)
* How components worked and to pass data and props between them
* Custom events
* Loops in Vue(V-for)
* v-bind and v-on
* v-if / v-else / v-else/-if
* methods
* computed option
* data()
* Vue Router
* Primitive UI
